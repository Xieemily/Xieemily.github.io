My name is Xieemily. I have the following qualities:

- I'm a professional procrastinator with a PhD in Netflix binging and a black belt in snackology. I firmly believe that my spirit animal is a sloth on a coffee break. 
- I'm an aspiring writer fueled by daydreams, constantly plotting world domination through witty dialogue and plot twists, waiting for my Oscar-worthy momentâ€¦ 

What else do you need?
